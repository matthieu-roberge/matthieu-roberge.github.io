Creative Coding
With creative coding, I discovered how to use code to create interactive and original works. What fascinates me is that something as technical as programming can offer infinite creativity. I started with the basics through the "Bits and Atoms" module, which introduced me to the fundamentals. What I particularly enjoy is the connection to mathematics: having done a lot of math, I find it exciting to transform abstract concepts into visual and dynamic creations.

## Project 1
This code generates a 3D plane made of a mesh of vertices stored in an array. The surface deforms using sine waves, with amplitude and speed controlled by the mouse position. Ambient and directional lights add visual depth. On specific vertices, the text "Hello Zhdk" is displayed, positioned above the surface and oriented to remain readable. The animation runs smoothly in real-time, bringing a dynamic and interactive shape to life.

## Project 2
This code generates a real-time interactive visual that reacts to sound captured by the microphone. Particles, influenced by Perlin noise, move fluidly, with their speed and colors changing based on sound intensity. While it works well with a microphone, it’s even more responsive with a connected guitar and will be used in an upcoming live musical performance.

## Project 3
"Drunk in Space" is a fun little game set in a stylized space universe. This project was very interesting to work on because it allowed me to learn how to use classes in p5.js, an essential skill for organizing code more effectively. I also revisited the basics we had covered before, like creating shapes and designing backgrounds, which helped me represent space in a simple yet cohesive way while strengthening my knowledge of creative coding.
