Creative Coding
With creative coding, I discovered how to use code to create interactive and original works. What fascinates me is that something as technical as programming can offer infinite creativity. I started with the basics through the "Bits and Atoms" module, which introduced me to the fundamentals. What I particularly enjoy is the connection to mathematics: having done a lot of math, I find it exciting to transform abstract concepts into visual and dynamic creations.

## Project 1
This code generates a 3D plane made of a mesh of vertices stored in an array. The surface deforms using sine waves, with amplitude and speed controlled by the mouse position. Ambient and directional lights add visual depth. On specific vertices, the text "Hello Zhdk" is displayed, positioned above the surface and oriented to remain readable. The animation runs smoothly in real-time, bringing a dynamic and interactive shape to life.
